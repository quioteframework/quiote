# Plugin Extraction Plan — slimming quiote-core into an unopinionated kernel + opinionated drop-ins

## Status — in progress

This plan takes the framework's stated philosophy ("unopinionated core + opinionated
drop-ins", `docs/PLUGIN_AND_EXTENSIBILITY_PLAN.md`) to its conclusion: move opinionated,
optional, or heavy-dependency subsystems out of `Quiote/` into separately-installable
composer packages under `quioteframework/*`, so a minimal app pulls only the kernel and
opts into the rest with `composer require quioteframework/mcp` (etc.) — CSRF is the one
deliberate exception, see "Registration policy" below.

**Progress:** §2's core seam gaps (2.1–2.4) are closed. **All 9 Tier-1 packages are now
physically split** into `packages/*` (see docs/MONOREPO_SPLIT_PLAN.md): `mcp`, `ratelimit`,
`csrf`, `whoops`, `db-eloquent`, `db-doctrine`, `db-cycle`, `telemetry-otel`,
`telemetry-dashboard` — none pushed to a standalone repo yet (that's
`docs/MONOREPO_SPLIT_PLAN.md`'s still-open step 3, no `split.yml` exists). Tier 2 (PHPTAL/XSLT
renderers, Gettext, RBAC, YAML config driver, PDO session backends) is the only thing left
in `Quiote/` from the original candidate catalog, unblocked but not yet moved.

**Registration policy — settled, supersedes the "all transitional" language below.** Every
extracted package's default posture was originally framed as transitional scaffolding pending a
future breaking-change release — that framing assumed an existing app population to avoid
breaking, which doesn't exist (this fork is days old, zero real installs). Given that, the
actual policy per package is now:
- **MCP, the 3 ORM adapters, `ratelimit`, `whoops`, `telemetry-otel`** — genuinely, permanently
  **opt-in**, exactly like `McpPlugin` always was: add the plugin class to the `plugins` config
  key, nothing runs otherwise. `Quiote::bootstrap()` registers none of these automatically (the
  telemetry-otel/whoops core-default blocks from §2.2/§2.4 below have been **removed** — see
  `WhoopsPlugin`, a new plugin class mirroring `CsrfPlugin`/`McpPlugin` so Whoops can actually be
  opted into now that nothing does it by default).
- **CSRF** — the one deliberate **opt-OUT** default, permanently, not a transitional step toward
  opt-in. It's a security default, not just a packaging convenience: `quioteframework/csrf` is a
  mandatory `require` of the kernel (not `require-dev`/`suggest`), and `Quiote::bootstrap()`
  always registers `CsrfPlugin` (behind a `class_exists()` guard for the "harder" opt-out path —
  see below). A fresh `quiote new` app is CSRF-protected without anyone having to know to ask.
  Disabling it takes conscious effort: the existing `core.csrf.enabled = false` runtime flag (the
  "soft" opt-out — already the gate both CSRF middleware read), or `composer remove
  quioteframework/csrf` (the "hard" opt-out — the `class_exists()` guard means this degrades to
  no CSRF rather than a fatal error, since the package genuinely can be absent now that it's not
  merely a compatibility fiction).
- **`telemetry-dashboard`** — unaffected by any of this; it was never conditionally registered
  for compatibility reasons, it's permanently excluded from the plugin-command system because it
  must run with zero bootstrap at all (§ below, unchanged).

The good news from the audit: **the seams already exist and most candidates are already
plugin-shaped.** The MCP subsystem and all three ORM adapters are self-contained plugins
today (their own docblocks anticipate the move). The work splits into three buckets:

1. **Close a handful of core seam gaps** that currently make clean extraction impossible
   (the critical path — do this first).
2. **Relocate** each subsystem into its own package + move its dependency out of core.
3. **Set up the distribution model** (how packages are developed, split, and versioned).

---

## 1. What the plugin system already gives us

`Quiote\Plugin\{PluginInterface, PluginRegistrar, PluginManager}` (see
`docs/PLUGIN_AND_EXTENSIBILITY_PLAN.md`). A plugin's `register(PluginRegistrar $r)` runs
once, during `Quiote::bootstrap()` after settings load (`PluginManager::bootFromConfig()`),
in deterministic order, driven by the `plugins` config key. Contribution seams:

| Seam | Method | Applied |
|---|---|---|
| Config defaults | `configDefault()` | immediately, set-if-absent |
| DI services | `service()` | per-context container (`Context::configureContainer`) |
| Middleware | `middleware()` / `attributedMiddleware()` | `MiddlewareCatalog` |
| Events | `listen()` | `Events` |
| Module dirs (routes) | `moduleDirectory()` | `AttributeRouteScanner` |
| Console commands | `command()` | `Console\Application` |
| DB driver aliases | `databaseDriver()` | `DatabaseDriverRegistry` |
| Named HTTP clients | `httpClient()` | `HttpClientFactory` |

MCP tools/resources/prompts are **not** in this table — `mcpTool()`/`mcpResource()`/`mcpPrompt()`
were removed from core `PluginRegistrar` (§2.1, done): a plugin that wants to contribute to
`Quiote\Mcp\McpCatalog` calls it directly instead of going through a bespoke core method.

**Config schema is not a blocker.** `settings` config is open key/value (`parts/settings.xsd`
allows arbitrary `<setting name="…">`), so a plugin can introduce any `csrf.*` / `telemetry.*`
key with no XSD change. Only `databases.xml` has a dedicated closed schema, and that describes
the *core* database config shape (adapters plug in by alias, not schema).

**Namespaces are not a blocker.** Everything is PSR-4 under the single `Quiote\` root.
Composer merges multiple packages contributing to the same prefix as long as paths don't
overlap, so `Quiote\Mcp\*` can move to package `quioteframework/mcp` autoloading
`Quiote\Mcp\` → its own `src/` **with zero class renames**.

---

## 2. Core seam gaps to close FIRST (the critical path)

These are the only places where core *reaches into* a candidate subsystem by concrete
class. Until each is inverted, the subsystem cannot leave core without creating a
core→package→core dependency cycle. Ordered by how many extractions they unblock.

### 2.1 Decouple `PluginRegistrar` from `McpCatalog` — *blocks MCP* — DONE
`Quiote/Plugin/PluginRegistrar.php:8,126-179` hard-`use`d `Quiote\Mcp\McpCatalog` for the
`mcpTool()/mcpResource()/mcpPrompt()` convenience methods. This is the **only** core→MCP
reference. Fix: drop those three methods from core `PluginRegistrar`; the MCP package
registers catalog entries directly in its own `McpPlugin::register()` (it already imports
`McpCatalog`), or via a small package-owned registrar extension. No general mechanism is lost
— MCP is the only consumer.

### 2.2 Add a process/request lifecycle hook for plugins — *blocks OTel exporter* — DONE
`Quiote/Runtime/Kernel.php` called `TelemetryBootstrap::configureFromConfig()` and
`TelemetryBootstrap::flushAfterRequest()` by hard FQCN. Fixed: a new
`Quiote\Event\Lifecycle\WorkerRequestCompletedEvent` fires once per request from the worker
`$reset` closure (the per-request-boundary counterpart to the existing `KernelBootEvent`);
`Kernel` now emits both events and names no concrete plugin class. New
`Quiote\Telemetry\TelemetryPlugin` listens to both and drives `TelemetryBootstrap` — registered
as a core default in `Quiote::bootstrap()` today (added to `PluginManager`'s own plugin list so
its `Events::listen()` calls only run once, via `bootFromConfig()`'s existing idempotency guard).
Verified end-to-end: a real bootstrap still configures the SDK provider and flushes on request
completion, identically to before.

### 2.3 Make the default middleware stack extensible / remove opinionated entries — *blocks CSRF* — DONE
`Quiote/Middleware/MiddlewarePipeline.php` hardcoded `CsrfInjectionMiddleware`/
`CsrfValidationMiddleware` in its `$factories` core stack. Fixed:
`MiddlewareCatalog::registerAttributed()` now accepts an optional per-context factory (called
with the building pipeline's `Context`, not captured at plugin-registration time — needed
because a plugin's `register()` runs before any `Context` exists), so ordering still comes from
the class's own `#[Middleware]` attribute while construction can safely reach that context's
own `Controller` rather than risk the DI container autowiring an unrelated one. New
`Quiote\Security\Csrf\CsrfPlugin` registers both middleware this way; the hardcoded
`$factories` entries are gone. Registered as a core default in `Quiote::bootstrap()` today.
Verified end-to-end: a real bootstrap produces the identical middleware stack, same position.
The cosmetic CSRF name-drop in `MiddlewareCatalog::REPLACE_CORE_STACK_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT` is left
as-is — still accurate, since CSRF still runs by default via the core-default plugin call.

### 2.4 Add an exception-renderer registry — *blocks Whoops* — DONE
`Quiote/Middleware/ErrorHandlingMiddleware.php` did `new WhoopsRenderer()` directly. Fixed: new
`Quiote\Exception\Rendering\ExceptionRendererRegistry` (set-if-absent, mirrors
`DatabaseDriverRegistry`) plus `PluginRegistrar::developerExceptionRenderer()`. The middleware
now resolves through the registry and falls back to `SafeRenderer` if nothing is registered;
core registers `WhoopsRenderer` as the default in `Quiote::bootstrap()` today, guarded by
`class_exists(\Whoops\Run::class)`.

**Superseded by the "Registration policy" note near the top of this doc.** All four
core-default registrations added by 2.2–2.4 were originally framed as transitional
compatibility scaffolding, each meant to be deleted once its package "really" shipped. That
framing assumed an existing app population to protect from a breaking change, which doesn't
exist. The telemetry-otel and whoops blocks have since been deleted outright (both are fully
opt-in now, no core-default at all); the CSRF block stays, but permanently, as a deliberate
opt-out default rather than a transitional stand-in for opt-in.

### 2.5 (Already clean — no core change) renderers, translators, user model, DB adapters, rate-limit
These select their implementation through existing config-driven registries/factories and
core never hard-references the concrete class:
- **Template renderers** (PHPTAL, XSLT): chosen per output-type via `View`/renderer config.
- **Translators** (Gettext): chosen per-domain via translation config `class`.
- **User model** (`RbacSecurityUser`): chosen via the user-factory config.
- **ORM adapters** (Eloquent/Doctrine/Cycle): attach via `DatabaseDriverRegistry` alias; core
  ships only `pdo`.
- **Rate limiting**: zero core references — pure lift-and-shift.

## 3. Candidate catalog

Ranked by value (dependency weight removed from a default install × how opinionated) vs
effort. "Dep in `require`" = currently forced on every install.

### Tier 1 — extract first

| Package (proposed) | Moves out of core | Dep freed | Core seam work | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `quioteframework/mcp` | `packages/mcp/src/*` + `McpPlugin` | `mcp/sdk` (require) | §2.1 — DONE | **DONE (in-tree split)** — symlinked via path repo; not yet pushed to a standalone repo |
| `quioteframework/db-eloquent` | `packages/db-eloquent/src/*` | `illuminate/database` (dev) | none | **DONE (in-tree split)** — zero namespace change, already a plugin |
| `quioteframework/db-doctrine` | `packages/db-doctrine/src/*` | `doctrine/orm`+`dbal` (dev) | none | **DONE (in-tree split)** — zero namespace change, already a plugin |
| `quioteframework/db-cycle` | `packages/db-cycle/src/*` | `cycle/orm`+`database` (dev) | none | **DONE (in-tree split)** — zero namespace change, already a plugin |
| `quioteframework/whoops` | `packages/whoops/src/WhoopsRenderer` | `filp/whoops` (moved to package require) | §2.4 — DONE | **DONE (in-tree split)** — renamespaced `Quiote\Exception\Rendering\WhoopsRenderer` → `Quiote\Exception\Rendering\Whoops\WhoopsRenderer` (avoids sharing a namespace with core's `ExceptionRenderer`/`SafeRenderer`/`NegotiatesContent`, which stay in `Quiote\Exception\Rendering`) |
| `quioteframework/ratelimit` | `packages/ratelimit/src/*` | `symfony/rate-limiter` (moved to package require) | none | **DONE (in-tree split)** — zero namespace change |
| `quioteframework/csrf` | `packages/csrf/src/*` (incl. the 2 CSRF middleware, under `src/Middleware/`) | `symfony/security-csrf` (moved to package require) | §2.3 — DONE | **DONE (in-tree split)** — the 2 middleware renamespaced `Quiote\Middleware\Csrf*Middleware` → `Quiote\Security\Csrf\Middleware\Csrf*Middleware` (same reasoning as Whoops) |
| `quioteframework/telemetry-otel` | `packages/telemetry-otel/src/*` (tier-b: exporter/bootstrap) | `open-telemetry/*` (moved to package require) | §2.2 — DONE | **DONE (in-tree split)** — kept the shared `Quiote\Telemetry\*` namespace (see below) |
| `quioteframework/telemetry-dashboard` | `packages/telemetry-dashboard/src/{Dashboard,Command}/*` | `symfony/tui` (moved to package require) | not needed (see below) | **DONE (in-tree split)** — kept both shared namespaces (see below) |

All 9 Tier-1 rows are now DONE: verified via `composer test` (1874 tests, unchanged count) and
scratch end-to-end scripts that run a real `Quiote::bootstrap()` — CSRF middleware land in the
identical pipeline position under their new namespace, Whoops registers identically,
`Trace::span()` returns a real `Quiote\Telemetry\OtelSpanHandle` once telemetry is configured,
and `bin/quiote list` / `bin/quiote telemetry:dashboard --help` both work exactly as before with
no bootstrap required. The two ORM-adapter integration tests that need real DB containers
(Doctrine, Eloquent) were also re-run standalone to confirm the fixture-class autoload fix
below; the failures observed there are Docker/testcontainers environment flakiness (container
start timeouts), not autoload or namespace regressions — Cycle's own integration test, which
needs no external container beyond SQLite, passed cleanly.

**telemetry-otel/telemetry-dashboard needed two design calls the others didn't:**
- **Kept the shared namespace, unlike Whoops/CSRF.** `Quiote\Telemetry\*` splits into an
  always-on, SDK-free tier-a (`Trace`, `TraceRegistry`, `SpanKind`, the no-op handles,
  `MiddlewareSpanDecorator` — stay in `Quiote/Telemetry/`) and an OTel-SDK-backed tier-b
  (`TelemetryBootstrap`, `OtelSpanHandle`, `OtelMeterHandle`, `ForceSampleSampler`,
  `Psr7HeaderGetter`/`Setter`, `TelemetryPlugin` — moved to `packages/telemetry-otel/src/`), but
  the cross-references between them are extensive and *functional*, not just adjacent:
  `Trace::span()`/`Trace::current()` directly `new OtelSpanHandle(...)`, and `TraceRegistry` has
  a typed `?OtelMeterHandle` property it instantiates. Renaming tier-b (the CSRF/Whoops pattern)
  would have meant threading `use` imports through `Trace.php`, `TraceRegistry.php`, plus two
  *other* core files that also reference tier-b classes directly —
  `Quiote\Middleware\TelemetryMiddleware` (`new Psr7HeaderGetter()`) and
  `Quiote\Http\Client\HttpClient` (`new Psr7HeaderSetter()`). Instead, `packages/telemetry-otel`'s
  own `composer.json` declares the *same* `Quiote\\Telemetry\\` PSR-4 prefix as the kernel;
  Composer's longest-prefix-first resolution checks the package's `src/` first for any
  `Quiote\Telemetry\*` class and falls back to the kernel's own directory for the rest — verified
  correct for both tiers via a script that resolves classes from each. The same trick applies to
  `TelemetryDashboardCommand`, which keeps `Quiote\Console\Command\*` (shared with
  `AboutCommand`/`RoutesListCommand`/etc.).
- **`TelemetryDashboardCommand` stays eagerly registered, NOT moved to the generic
  plugin-command seam.** The extraction plan originally flagged this as "a well-supported path"
  (the same mechanism `mcp:serve` uses) — that undersold a real regression: `bin/quiote` builds
  `Console\Application` *before* any `Quiote::bootstrap()` call, so a plugin-contributed command
  only appears once a bootstrap has already run in the same process (a pre-existing, documented
  limitation in `docs/PLUGIN_AND_EXTENSIBILITY_PLAN.md`'s "Command contribution boundary" —
  already true for `mcp:serve`, which never needed standalone `bin/quiote` invocation). Unlike
  `mcp:serve`, `telemetry:dashboard` is a standalone OTLP receiver/TUI process explicitly meant to
  run via `bin/quiote telemetry:dashboard` with no app bootstrap at all — moving it to the deferred
  seam would have silently broken that. Kept `Console\Application`'s direct
  `new TelemetryDashboardCommand()` call, only changing the guard from
  `class_exists(\Symfony\Component\Tui\Tui::class)` to `class_exists(TelemetryDashboardCommand::class)`
  (checking the package's own wrapper, consistent with the Whoops/CSRF/telemetry-otel core-default
  pattern) — verified via `bin/quiote list` and `bin/quiote telemetry:dashboard --help`.
- **`TelemetryPlugin`'s core-default registration in `Quiote::bootstrap()` needed a
  `class_exists()` guard it didn't have.** It was added unconditionally in §2.2 (safe at the
  time, since `TelemetryPlugin`/`TelemetryBootstrap` were still core and always autoloadable);
  once physically moved to a package that might not be installed, the unconditional
  `new \Quiote\Telemetry\TelemetryPlugin()` would fatal instead of degrading. Fixed to match the
  Whoops pattern: `if (class_exists(\Quiote\Telemetry\TelemetryPlugin::class)) { ... }`.

**Autoload gotcha hit and fixed:** the Doctrine/Cycle integration tests' entity fixtures
(`Quiote\Test\Database\Entity\{DoctrineUser,CycleUser}`) were initially declared in
`packages/db-doctrine|db-cycle/composer.json`'s own `autoload-dev` — this silently does
**nothing** while the package is installed as a path-repo dependency, because Composer only
ever loads a *dependency's* `autoload` section, never its `autoload-dev` (only the root
project's own `autoload-dev` is merged into the generated autoloader). Fixed by adding the
same PSR-4 mapping to the monorepo root's own `autoload-dev` (pointing at both packages'
`tests/Entity/` dirs — PSR-4 supports multiple directories per prefix). The packages' own
`autoload-dev` blocks are left in place with a comment explaining they'll activate once the
package is actually tested standalone post-split.

### Tier 2 — candidates the user hadn't flagged (from the hunt)

| Package (proposed) | Moves out of core | Dep freed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `quioteframework/phptal` | `Renderer/PhptalRenderer` | PHPTAL (**undeclared!**) | Also fixes a latent `require('PHPTAL.php')`; §2.5 clean |
| `quioteframework/xslt` | `Renderer/XsltRenderer` + `Util/QuioteXsltProcessor`, `SchematronProcessor` | `ext-xsl` (suggest) | §2.5 clean |
| `quioteframework/gettext` | `Translation/GettextTranslator` + `Translation/Gettext/*` | — | Largest opinionated code mass; interface layer (`ITranslator`, intl formatters, locale) **stays core** |
| `quioteframework/rbac` | `User/RbacSecurityUser` | — | Base `User`/`SecurityUser` identity stays core |
| `quioteframework/config-yaml` | `Config/Format/YamlFormatDriver` | `symfony/yaml` (**require**) | ⚠️ **bootstrap-ordering caveat**, see §5 |
| `quioteframework/session-pdo` | `Session/PdoSessionPersistence`, `Storage/PdoSessionStorage` | — | Easy slice of Session; full Session split is Tier 3 (CSRF/middleware entanglement) |

### Tier 3 / must-stay-core (evaluated, rejected)
- **`Telemetry` facade tier-a** (`Trace`, `TraceRegistry`, `SpanKind`, no-op handles,
  `MiddlewareSpanDecorator`): called from ~7 hot-path core sites; carries **zero** hard OTel-SDK
  dependency (lazy type hints only). Keep in core — it's the always-safe no-op contract.
- **`Http/Client`**: it *is* the telemetry egress seam and a first-class plugin hook
  (`configureHttpClients`). Stays.
- **`Logging/Sink`**: already fully decoupled behind `SinkInterface`; nothing to fix.
- **`middlewares/negotiation`, `middlewares/payload`, `symfony/mime`, `symfony/console`**:
  core request/CLI plumbing.
- **Core Database abstraction** (`Database`, `DatabaseManager`, `DatabaseDriverRegistry`,
  `AbstractOrmDatabase`, `PdoDatabase`): the contract adapters build on. Stays. (Legacy
  `PropelDatabase`/`Doctrine2*Database` are separate dead-code cleanup, tracked in
  `docs/DATABASE_ADAPTERS_PLAN.md`.)

---

## 4. Distribution & packaging model

No monorepo/subtree tooling exists yet. Recommended: **monorepo-with-read-only-splits**
(the Symfony/Laravel model), not hand-maintained separate dev repos.

- **Develop in-tree**: subsystems stay in the `quiote` repo under `Quiote/<Sub>/` so the full
  integration test suite keeps exercising them together against the kernel.
- **Split on tag**: a GitHub Action (e.g. `splitsh/lite`) mirrors each subsystem subtree to a
  read-only `quioteframework/<pkg>` repo, so Packagist serves `composer require
  quioteframework/mcp`. Consumers never see the monorepo.
- **Per-package `composer.json`**: each split carries its own manifest — `require:
  quioteframework/quiote` (kernel) + its freed dependency (e.g. `filp/whoops`), PSR-4 for its
  slice of the `Quiote\` namespace, and (where relevant) its own `suggest`.
- **Versioning**: lockstep-tag all packages to the kernel version initially (simplest;
  matches the monorepo model). Kernel declares each as `suggest`, never `require` — except
  `quioteframework/csrf`, the deliberate opt-out default (see "Registration policy" above),
  which the kernel `require`s like any other real dependency.
- **Optional meta-package** `quioteframework/quiote-full` that requires the common drop-ins,
  for users who want today's batteries-included install in one line.
- **Scaffolding**: `NewCommand`/`AppWriter` should offer a "batteries" toggle that adds the
  common plugins to the generated `plugins` config + `composer.json`.

---

## 5. Risks & caveats

- **Bootstrap-phase ordering (YAML driver).** Plugins boot *after* config loads
  (`PluginManager::bootFromConfig()` runs inside `Quiote::bootstrap()`), but a config **format
  driver** must exist *before* config is read — chicken/egg. `quioteframework/config-yaml`
  therefore cannot register through the normal `plugins` key; it needs a pre-bootstrap
  registration path (composer autoload + a `FormatDriverRegistry` entry loaded eagerly), or it
  stays in core. Flag before committing to extracting it.
- ~~**Behavior change: CSRF becomes opt-in.**~~ **Superseded — CSRF stays opt-out,
  permanently** (see "Registration policy" near the top). No BC break to plan for: the package
  physically moved, but `quioteframework/csrf` is a mandatory `require` of the kernel and
  `CsrfPlugin` is always registered, so behavior is unchanged for any app, existing or future.
  Disabling it is the deliberate exception, gated by `core.csrf.enabled` (soft) or `composer
  remove quioteframework/csrf` (hard, degrades gracefully via a `class_exists()` guard).
- **The telemetry facade must not follow the exporter out.** Extracting tier-b/c while keeping
  tier-a in core is the whole point; conflating them would force rewriting every `Trace::span()`
  call site behind an indirection. Keep the boundary crisp.
- **Deps currently mis-filed as `require`.** `filp/whoops`, `symfony/security-csrf`,
  `symfony/rate-limiter`, `symfony/yaml`, and the entire `open-telemetry/*` + `symfony/tui` set
  are in the main `require` block despite serving optional features. Extracting Tier-1 directly
  slims the default install; even before extraction, several could move to `suggest`.
- **PHPTAL is an undeclared dependency** (`require('PHPTAL.php')` at runtime, absent from
  `composer.json`). Extraction is also the fix for this correctness bug.
- **Two `SessionMiddleware` files** appear to exist (`Quiote/Session/` and `Quiote/Middleware/`)
  — confirm which is live before touching Session.

## 6. Suggested sequencing

1. ~~**Enabling core work** (no extraction yet, all internal, fully testable): §2.1 MCP
   decouple, §2.4 renderer registry, §2.2 lifecycle hooks, §2.3 middleware-stack
   extensibility.~~ **DONE.**
2. **Distribution scaffolding**: set up the split Action + one throwaway package to prove the
   pipeline end-to-end. **Partially done** — the `packages/*` path-repository mechanics are
   proven (9 packages symlinked and green); the actual `splitsh/lite` GitHub Action
   (`docs/MONOREPO_SPLIT_PLAN.md`'s `split.yml`) has **not** been built yet — still the next
   step before any package is consumable outside this monorepo.
3. ~~**Lift-and-shift the already-clean plugins** (lowest risk, immediate dependency wins):
   ORM adapters, MCP, rate-limit, Whoops, telemetry-dashboard.~~ **DONE** — `mcp`,
   `db-eloquent`, `db-doctrine`, `db-cycle`, `ratelimit`, `whoops`, and `telemetry-dashboard`
   are all physically split into `packages/*`.
4. ~~**Extractions needing the new seams**: CSRF, telemetry-otel.~~ **DONE** —
   `packages/csrf/` and `packages/telemetry-otel/` both split.
5. **Tier 2 opinionated code**: PHPTAL/XSLT, Gettext, RBAC, (YAML pending §5), session-PDO.
   **Not started.**
6. **Docs + meta-package + scaffolder toggle**; announce BC breaks. **Partially done.**
   `quioteframework/mcp`/`ratelimit`/`whoops`/`db-*`/`telemetry-otel` are now genuinely opt-in
   (their core-default registrations, where they existed, are deleted — see "Registration
   policy" near the top of this doc); no BC break to announce for these since nothing depended
   on their old defaults. CSRF is deliberately **not** part of that flip — it stays a permanent
   opt-out default (mandatory `require`, always registered), so there's no future "CSRF becomes
   opt-in" migration to plan for at all. Still not started: a `quioteframework/quiote-full`
   meta-package, and `NewCommand` scaffolding review (worth checking whether the scaffolder
   should also default-suggest `telemetry-otel`/`whoops` for a new app, now that they require a
   conscious `plugins` addition to get at all).
